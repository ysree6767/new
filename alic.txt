Hello,
We set an initial state inside the
 constructor or outside the constructor of a class based component. 
We do not directly change or mutate the state 
but we use the setState() method to reset to a new state.


Now, let's add some methods which increase or decrease the value of
 count by clicking a button. Let us add a button to increase and a 
button to decrease the value of count. To set the state we use react
 method this.setState. See the example below
