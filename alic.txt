We set an initial state inside the
 constructor or outside the constructor of a class based component. 
We do not directly change or mutate the state 
but we use the setState() method to reset to a new state. 
. As you can see below in the state object we have 
count with initial value 0. We can access the
 state object using this.state and the property name
